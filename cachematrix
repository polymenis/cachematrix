# There are two functions described below:

## First, we are storing the data so future requests
## for that data are completed faster, because they
## don't have to be looked up and read each time.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function() inv <<- solve(x) #calculate the inverse
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


## The second function that follows, 'cacheSolve', should retrieve the inverse from the cached
## data.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
